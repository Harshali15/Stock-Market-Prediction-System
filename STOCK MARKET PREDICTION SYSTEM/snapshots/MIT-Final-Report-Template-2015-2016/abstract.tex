Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue to plague the Internet. Defense against these attacks is complicated by spoofed source IP addresses. This makes it difficult to determine a packet’s true origin. Path Identifier (Pi) is a new packet marking approach with embeded path 
	
	


	The Pi has many unique features. It is per-packet deterministic mechanism: each packet traveling along the same path carries the same identifier. This allows the victim to take a proactive role in defending against a DDoS attack using the Pi mark to filter out packets matching the attackers’ identifiers on a per packet basis.
